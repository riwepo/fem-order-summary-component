## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was the first task I have done with mobile first workflow, previously I have always doen desktop first.

### Continued development

I'm still not comfortable with positioning the whole component on the screen for the different cases of mobile and desktop. Just not sure if I'm doing it correctly. Also I have only added one media query breakpoint, not sure if I need to add more or how to tell how many I need.
